## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

3. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.

5. Gradually blend the dry ingredients into the wet mixture.

6. Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts if using.

7. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets.

8. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are golden brown.

9. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes before transferring to wire racks.

## Tips

- For extra chewy cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar.
- Chilling the dough for 24 hours before baking will enhance the flavor.
- Use chocolate chunks instead of chips for more texture variation.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
