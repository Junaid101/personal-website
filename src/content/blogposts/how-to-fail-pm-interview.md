## What the Product Manager Should Have Answered:  

### 1️⃣ Understand Business and Customer Impact  
"I’d evaluate both features based on their potential impact on business goals and customer satisfaction. For example, Feature B might have a stronger case if it addresses a major pain point directly tied to retention."  

### 2️⃣ Leverage Data  
"I’d use data to build a case for prioritization. If Feature B has clear metrics showing improved customer retention or reduced churn, I’d advocate for it using these insights."  

### 3️⃣ Facilitate Transparent Conversations  
"I’d bring both sides to the table—leadership and customer-facing teams—to discuss trade-offs and align on the best decision for long-term value."  

### 4️⃣ Communicate the Why  
"Whatever decision we make, I’d ensure stakeholders and teams understand the rationale. Alignment is key to executing effectively."
